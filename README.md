# Word-Tree
 This program defines a Node class that represents a node in a tree structure, likely for use in a word game or similar application. Each node contains a character, level, frequency, and flags indicating if it is the end of a word. Nodes can have parent and child relationships, allowing the construction of a tree. The class includes methods to:  Initialize a node with given attributes. Convert the node to a string representing the word formed by traversing up to the root. Calculate a score based on the frequency of the node and its ancestors. Add a child node to the current node.
